	abstract = {We examine the impact of strategy and dexterity on video games in which a player must use strategy to decide between multiple moves and must use dexterity to correctly execute those moves. We run simulation experiments on variants of two popular, interactive puzzle games: Tetris, which exhibits dexterity in the form of speed-accuracy time pressure, and Puzzle Bobble, which requires precise aiming. By modeling dexterity and strategy as separate components, we quantify the effect of each type of difficulty using normalized mean score and artificial intelligence agents that make human-like errors. We show how these techniques can model and visualize dexterity and strategy requirements as well as the effect of scoring systems on expressive range.},

The end goal of such procedural personas is substituting players when authoring game content manually, procedurally, or both (in a mixed-initiative setting). Building on previous work, we compare the performance of newly evolved agents to agents trained via Q-learning as well as a number of baseline agents. Comparisons are performed on the grounds of game playing ability, generalizability, and conformity among agents. Finally, all agents' decision making styles are matched to the decision making styles of human players in order to investigate whether the different methods can yield agents who mimic or differ from human decision making in similar ways. The experiments performed in this paper conclude that agents developed from a priori defined objectives can express human decision making styles and that they are more generalizable and versatile than Q-learning and hand-crafted agents.},

Reasons for this data surge are many and include the introduction of new business models, technical innovations, the popularity of online games, and the increasing persistence of games. Irrespective of the causes, the proliferation of behavioral data poses the problem of how to derive insights therefrom. Behavioral data sets can be large, time-dependent and high-dimensional. Clustering offers a way to explore such data and to discover patterns that can reduce the overall complexity of the data. Clustering and other techniques for player profiling and play style analysis have, therefore, become popular in the nascent field of game analytics. However, the proper use of clustering techniques requires expertise and an understanding of games is essential to evaluate results. With this paper, we address game data scientists and present a review and tutorial focusing on the application of clustering techniques to mine behavioral game data. Several algorithms are reviewed and examples of their application shown. Key topics such as feature normalization are discussed and open problems in the context of game analytics are pointed out.},

	abstract = {Successful analysis of player skills in video games has important impacts on the process of enhancing player experience without undermining their continuous skill development. Moreover, player skill analysis becomes more intriguing in team-based video games because such form of study can help discover useful factors in effective team formation. In this paper, we consider the problem of skill decomposition in {MOBA} ({MultiPlayer} Online Battle Arena) games, with the goal to understand what player skill factors are essential for the outcome of a game match. To understand the construct of {MOBA} player skills, we utilize various skill-based predictive models to decompose player skills into interpretative parts, the impact of which are assessed in statistical terms. We apply this analysis approach on two widely known {MOBAs}, namely League of Legends ({LoL}) and Defense of the Ancients 2 ({DOTA}2). The finding is that base skills of in-game avatars, base skills of players, and players' champion-specific skills are three prominent skill components influencing {LoL}'s match outcomes, while those of {DOTA}2 are mainly impacted by in-game avatars' base skills but not much by the other two.},

	abstract = {Intelligent agents are widely used in robotics, gaming and simulation. A key issue is modelling human behaviours so that intelligent agents can use a human‚Äôs behavioural model to imitate them and predict their next moves. In this article, we use Internet-based multiplayer online gaming ({MOG}) as a case study to present our approach to predictive user modelling through behavioural analysis of online gameplay data. As latency is an inherited bottleneck of the Internet and is likely to remain so into a foreseeable future, a lot of efforts have been made to address the resulting issues. Most of the existing latency handling techniques are based on the assumption that latency is within an acceptable threshold so that they can alleviate or even completely hide its negative impact on players‚Äô quality of experience ({QoE}) that directly determines consumers‚Äô satisfaction of the provided {MOG} services. While this assumption is mostly valid, it is worth noting that a player‚Äôs Internet connection latency always fluctuates (known as jitter), possibly to the extent of exceeding a {MOG}‚Äôs designated threshold in which case none of the techniques can handle properly but disconnecting the player from the gameplay session. Forcing a player to quit prematurely simply due to a spike of unusual high latency has a significant negative impact both on the gameplay‚Äôs fairness and on the player‚Äôs {QoE}. To improve customer satisfaction of a {MOG} service, we propose a more tolerant approach by temporarily substituting a player with a humanoid bot in the event of latency hikes so that the player always remains in the gameplay session. The challenge in this approach is to create a personalised humanoid bot that can imitate the playing pattern of the individual human player being substituted. Our solution is to first extract key variables that have impact on the human player‚Äôs decision-makings through behavioural analysis of the player‚Äôs historical gameplay data, then model the relationships among these variables, and finally creates the player‚Äôs humanoid bot with the model. In this paper, we use a multiplayer online pong game as a case study to explain behavioural variables, modelling techniques, processes, outcomes, and performance studies.},

The network correctly predicts the expert move in 55\% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a 6 dan human player. When the trained convolutional network was used directly to play games of Go, without any search, it beat the traditional search program {GnuGo} in 97\% of games, and matched the performance of a state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulates a million positions per move.},

A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is then used to evolve complete {StarCraft} maps based on the representation and selected fitness functions. The output of this algorithm is a Pareto front approximation visualizing the tradeoff between the several fitness functions used, and where each point on the front represents a viable map.

Indeed, a recognized major concern for the game developers' community is to provide mechanisms to dynamically balance the difficulty level of the games in order to keep the user interested in playing. This work presents an innovative use of reinforcement learning techniques to build intelligent agents that adapt their behavior in order to provide dynamic game balancing. The idea is to couple learning with an action selection mechanism which depends on the evaluation of the current user's skills. To validate our approach, we applied it to a real-time fighting game, obtaining good results, as the adaptive agent is able to quickly play at the same level as opponents with different skills.},

The methods that are compared are either hand-coded, direct (based on supervised learning) or indirect (based on maximising a similarity measure). We find that a method based on neuroevolution performs best both in terms of the instrumental similarity measure and in phenomenological evaluation by human spectators.

Our qualitative results show that people do care about the perceived nature of other players, even though they are not always able to correctly identify them as human or as non-player character teammates. Interview data suggest believing that one is playing with other humans can positively affect a player's subjective experience. Furthermore, our qualitative results indicate that players view their non-player character teammates as humanized entities, but adopt a neo-feudalistic (i.e., an unequal rights) view of them. Based on our results, we establish game design guide- lines for non-player character teammates leading to stronger, emotional human-computer relationships in video games.},

There are different approaches and techniques to gather the metrics data; however there seems to be a lack of frameworks to read and make sense of it. In this paper, the concept of play-persona is applied to game metrics, in the specific case of character-based computer games, where the player controls a single protagonist, around whom the gameplay and -- story evolves. A case is presented for Hitman: Blood Money ({IO} Interactive, 2007). Player-controlled game characters can be deconstructed into a range of components and these expressed as monitored game metrics. These metrics can subsequently be utilized to discover patterns of play by building play-personas: Modeled representations of how players interact with the game. This process can also be useful to assist game design, by informing whether the game facilitates the specific play patterns implied by theoretical play-personas.},

Results reveal that linear regression models and other non-linear classification techniques perform well on the tasks and that decision tree learning induces small yet well-performing and informative trees. Moderate performance is achieved from the prediction models, which indicates the complexity of predicting player behavior based on a constrained set of gameplay metrics and the noise existent in the dataset examined, a generic problem in large-scale data collection from millions of remote clients.},

Although state-of-the-art deep learning models for video game tasks generally rely on more complex methods such as deep-Q learning, we show that a supervised model which requires substantially fewer resources and training time can already perform well at human reaction speeds on the N64 classic game Super Smash Bros. We frame our learning task as a 30-class classification problem, and our {CNN} model achieves 80\% top-1 and 95\% top-3 validation accuracy. With slight test-time fine-tuning, our model is also competitive during live simulation with the highest-level {AI} built into the game. We will further show evidence through network visualizations that the network is successfully leveraging temporal information during inference to aid in decision making. Our work demonstrates that supervised {CNN} models can provide good performance in challenging policy prediction tasks while being significantly simpler and more lightweight than alternatives.},

These three methods are then compared on their ability to represent individual human decision makers. Comparisons are conducted using three different proposed metrics that address the problem of matching decisions at the action, tactical, and strategic levels. Results indicate that a small gallery of personas evolved from designer intuitions can capture human decision making styles equally well as clones evolved from human play-traces for the testbed game {MiniDungeons}.},

	abstract = {Critical acclaim is considered to be one of the main predictors of profitability of game products. Major game publishers face tremendous hurdles in order to fare well in different forums that review and rate their products. However, little evidence exists on the relationship between ratings and profitability beyond anecdotal assumptions. In this study we investigate the relationship between critical acclaim and commercial success in mobile free-to-play games via a mixed-method study. First we look at the correlation of reviews and profitability, and then present an exploratory qualitative inquiry, analyzing games with high Metascores and games with high grossing. The results reveal that the relationship between review ratings and profitability is even more problematic in mobile free-to-play games than in many other game categories. Games with high Metascores differ substantially from the top-grossing games, being closer to traditional single-player games than typical free-to-play games, with little emphasis on monetization mechanics.},

Interestingly, until now procedural content generation ({PCG}) has nevertheless been investigated almost exclusively in the context of competitive, skills-based gaming. This paper therefore opens a new direction for {PCG} by placing it at the center of an entirely casual flower-breeding game platform called Petalz. That way, the behavior of players and their reactions to different game mechanics in a casual environment driven by {PCG} can be investigated. In particular, players in Petalz can: 1) trade their discoveries in a global marketplace; 2) respond to an incentive system that awards diversity; and 3) generate real-world 3-D replicas of their evolved flowers. With over 1900 registered online users and 38 646 unique evolved flowers, Petalz showcases the potential for {PCG} to enable these kinds of casual game mechanics, thus paving the way for continued innovation with {PCG} in casual gaming.},

	doi = {10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2038365},
	abstract = {Simulation and game content includes the levels, models, textures, items, and other objects encountered and possessed by players during the game. In most modern video games and in simulation software, the set of content shipped with the product is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly and automatically renewed, players would remain engaged longer. This paper introduces two novel technologies that take steps toward achieving this ambition: 1) a new algorithm called content-generating {NeuroEvolution} of Augmenting Topologies ({cgNEAT}) is introduced that automatically generates graphical and game content while the game is played, based on the past preferences of the players, and 2) Galactic Arms Race ({GAR}), a multiplayer video game, is constructed to demonstrate automatic content generation in a real online gaming platform. In {GAR}, which is available to the public and playable online, players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle system weapons that are automatically evolved by the {cgNEAT} algorithm. A study of the behavior and results from over 1000 registered online players shows that {cgNEAT} indeed enables players to discover a wide variety of appealing content that is not only novel, but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred in the past. Thus, {GAR} is the first demonstration of evolutionary content generation in an online multiplayer game. The implication is that with {cgNEAT} it is now possible to create applications that generate their own content to satisfy users, potentially reducing the cost of content creation and increasing entertainment value from single-player to massively multiplayer online games ({MMOGs}) with a constant stream of evolving content.},

Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Furthermore, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified. The principles of machine learning verified by these experiments are, of course, applicable to many other situations.},

Several changes have recently been made to {UT}{\textasciicircum}2: Extra input features have been provided to the bot to help it evolve better combat behavior, the role of human traces in the navigation of the bot has been expanded, and an extra control module has been added which encourages the bot to observe other players the way a human would, rather than simply battle them. These changes should make {UT}{\textasciicircum}2 act more human-like in this year's {BotPrize} competition.},

	abstract = {We consider scenarios from the real-time strategy game {StarCraft} as new benchmarks for reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose micromanagement tasks, which present the problem of the short-term, low-level control of army members during a battle. From a reinforcement learning point of view, these scenarios are challenging because the state-action space is very large, and because there is no obvious feature representation for the state-action evaluation function. We describe our approach to tackle the micromanagement scenarios with deep neural network controllers from raw state features given by the game engine. In addition, we present a heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm which combines direct exploration in the policy space and backpropagation. This algorithm allows for the collection of traces for learning using deterministic policies, which appears much more efficient than, for example, \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}-greedy exploration. Experiments show that with this algorithm, we successfully learn non-trivial strategies for scenarios with armies of up to 15 agents, where both Q-learning and {REINFORCE} struggle.},

Efficient learning for intra-agent communication and coordination is an indispensable step towards general {AI}. In this paper, we take {StarCraft} combat game as a case study, where the task is to coordinate multiple agents as a team to defeat their enemies. To maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Network ({BiCNet} ['{bIknet}]) with a vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that {BiCNet} can handle different types of combats with arbitrary numbers of {AI} agents for both sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human demonstrations or labelled data, {BiCNet} could learn various types of advanced coordination strategies that have been commonly used by experienced game players. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach against multiple baselines under different scenarios; it shows state-of-the-art performance, and possesses potential values for large-scale real-world applications.},

The network is self-organized by ‚Äúlearning without a teacher‚Äù, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname ‚Äúneocognitron‚Äù. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of ‚ÄúS-cells‚Äù, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of ‚ÄúC-cells‚Äù similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any ‚Äúteacher‚Äù during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a demonstration of how {AI} can be useful in the game design and development process of a modern board game. By using an artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence algorithm to play a substantial amount of matches of the Ticket to Ride board game and collecting data, we can analyze several features of the gameplay as well as of the game board. Results revealed loopholes in the game‚Äôs rules and pointed towards trends in how the game is played. We are then led to the conclusion that large scale simulation utilizing artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence can offer valuable information regarding modern board games and their designs that would ordinarily be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to discover manually.},

	abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation ({PCM}), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2{\textasciicircum}bquanta,b=1,2, cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

	title = {Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units ({ELUs})},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07289},
	abstract = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" ({ELU}) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units ({ReLUs}), leaky {ReLUs} ({LReLUs}) and parametrized {ReLUs} ({PReLUs}), {ELUs} alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, {ELUs} have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to {ReLUs}, {ELUs} have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While {LReLUs} and {PReLUs} have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. {ELUs} saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, {ELUs} code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, {ELUs} lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than {ReLUs} and {LReLUs} on networks with more than 5 layers. On {CIFAR}-100 {ELUs} networks significantly outperform {ReLU} networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve {ELU} networks. {ELU} networks are among the top 10 reported {CIFAR}-10 results and yield the best published result on {CIFAR}-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On {ImageNet}, {ELU} networks considerably speed up learning compared to a {ReLU} network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10\% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

This paper presents a new Bayesian technique for supervised learning of such patterns from game records, based on a generalization of Elo ratings. Each sample move in the training data is considered as a victory of a team of pattern features. Elo ratings of individual pattern features are computed from these victories, and can be used in previously unseen positions to compute a probability distribution over legal moves. In this approach, several pattern features may be combined, without an exponential cost in the number of features. Despite a very small number of training games (652), this algorithm outperforms most previous pattern-learning algorithms, both in terms of mean log-evidence (‚àí2.69), and prediction rate (34.9\%). A 19x19 Monte-Carlo program improved with these patterns reached the level of the strongest classical programs.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" ({NIN}) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as {CNN}; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep {NIN} can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with {NIN} on {CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100, and reasonable performances on {SVHN} and {MNIST} datasets.},
